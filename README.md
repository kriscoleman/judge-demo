# demo-repo

## Welcome to a JUDGE On-boarding Demo

This is a template repository that is best used to create your own repo to customize.

## "Typical" workflow experience (WIP)

1. Take a look at the pipeline.yaml to see what the current build process looks like. It's a simple Docker build of a container image with a subsequent SBOM generation step.
2. Next look at PR1
3. Next look at PR2
4. Finally kick off the manual VEX workflow.
